# iVim: Vim inspired color scheme

![screenshot-cpp](screenshot.png)

> A color scheme inspired by Vim's default color scheme.

## Install

Move to the [releases](https://github.com/jan509/iVim/release) page and download the latest release.
Unpack the downloaded TAR/ZIP archive and paste the themes into your Packages folder. Please know that the location
can be different when using different editors/operating systems. Currently the Theme was tested with Sublime Text 3.

## FAQ

#### What is ``iVim (colored comments).tmTheme``?

Vim's default color scheme marks TODOs with a yellow color which looks pretty dang! But instead of doing this for all comments there is a special one (``iVim (colored comments).tmTheme``) which you can also use.

#### Does this Theme works with Textmate?

Normally every theme with the extension ``.tmTheme`` works with Textmate.

#### Which editors are supported?

Currently I only know that this theme works with:
- Sublime Text 2/3
- Textmate

*BTW: Test other editors and tell about it!*
